README

  Split is developed by Piada Studios for CMU 53-471.

DESCRIPTION

  Split is a 2-player co-op platformer where players control elemental creatures.
  One player controls a light creature and the other controls a dark creature. 
  Each player has a separate dark or light world, and must make their way through
  the levels together avoiding enemies and collecting energy. The goal is for the
  players to merge together after they have collected all the energy so that they
  are not split any longer.
  
RUN DIRECTIONS AND HOW-TO-PLAY

  This game is built for Mac OS and Windows. Simply running the Unity build 
  should start the game.

  The light player uses w to jump and a/d to move left and right. Use left 
  shift to take over enemies, and while controlling an enemy, use a/d to rotate 
  it anti-clockwise/clockwise.

  The dark player uses up arrow key to jump and left/right arrow keys to move
